We’re based in California-- many of us with roots in the Antelope Valley. Our mission:</p><p id="mission-statement">To break cycles of poverty, empower at-risk populations, and diversify the computer science field by providing training and resources for building community-owned technological solutions.</p><p>Essentially, we want to give people who could really use it an opportunity to jump-start a new career in tech. We planned to start by partnering with local high schools in the Antelope Valley, targeting at-risk students. We wanted to host a hackathon—an event where they would code their own apps in teams. However, our priorities shifted when the needs of the world shifted.</p><p>Now we’re focusing on highlighting available resources that could help people with what they’re dealing with around COVID-19. A lot of people have lost their jobs, and even their businesses, and m any are unsure of the future of their industries in general. Our focus is to provide resources to people who need a shift in their career, or even just need a new and innovative way to quickly make a livable wage during these uncertain times.</p><p>For more information on the resources that may help, check out the links in the COVID-19 section.</p></div></section></div></main><footer class="site-footer"></footer><script src="/hackertunity-client/assets/js/navbar.js"></script></body></html>
